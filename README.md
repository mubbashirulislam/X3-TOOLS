# X3-TOOLS
 X3 Tools, developed by me (X3NIDE), is a Windows utility that simplifies software installation. It offers a user-friendly interface with a curated list of applications across categories. Leveraging AI,  I created this tool to streamline system setup and upgrades, using the Windows Package Manager (winget) for efficient program installation.
